```{admonition} Gifts from Zeus, Callimachus

In *Callimachus and Lycophron*, transl. Alexander W. Mair 1921, [pp61-3](https://archive.org/details/callimachuslycop00calluoft/page/60/mode/2up):

Hymn III — Τo ARTEMIS

Artemis we hymn—no light thing is it for singers to forget her—whose study is the bow and the shooting of hares and the spacious dance and sport upon the mountains; beginning with the time when sitting on her father’s knees—still a little maid— she spake these words to her sire: “Give me to keep my maidenhood, Father, for ever: and give me to be of many names, that Phoebus may not vie with me. And give me arrows and a bow—stay, Father, I ask thee not for quiver or for mighty bow: for me the Cyclopes will straightway fashion arrows and fashion for me a well-bent bow. But give me to be the Bringer of Light and give me to gird me in a tunic ὃ with embroidered border reaching to the knee, that I may slay wild beasts. And give me sixty daughters of Oceanus for my choir— all nine years old, all maidens yet ungirdled; and give me for handmaidens twenty nymphs of Amnisus ¢ who shall tend well my buskins, and, when I shoot no more at lynx or stag, shall tend my swift hounds. And give to me all mountains; and for city, assign me any, even whatsoever thou wilt: for seldom is it that Artemis goes down to the town. On the mountains will 1 dwell and the cities of men | will visit only when women vexed by the sharp pangs of childbirth call me to their aid*—even in the hour when I was born the Fates ordained that I should be their helper, forasmuch as my mother suffered no pain either when she gave me birth or when she carried me in her womb, but. without travail put me from her body.” So spake the child and would have touched her father’s beard, but many a hand did she reach forth in vain, that she might touch it. And her father smiled and bowed assent. And as he caressed her, he said: “When goddesses bear me children like this, little need I heed the wrath of jealous Hera. Take, child, all that thou askest, heartily. Yea, and other things therewith yet greater will thy father give thee. Three times ten cities and towers more than one will I vouchsafe thee—three times ten cities that shall not know to glorify any other god but to glorify thee only and be called of Artemis; and many cities will I give thee to share with others, both inland cities and islands; and in them all shall be altars and groves of Artemis. And thou shalt be Watcher over Streets® and Harbours.¢”’ So he spake and bent his head to confirm his words. And the maiden fared unto the white mountain of Crete leafy with woods; thence unto Oceanus; and she chose many nymphs all nine years old, all maidens yet ungirdled. And the river Caeratus@ was glad exceedingly, and glad was Tethys that they were sending their daughters to be handmaidens to the daughter of Leto.
