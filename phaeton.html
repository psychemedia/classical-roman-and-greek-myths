<p>I first heard this tale told in modern form, in the round, in a performace of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.wrightandgrainger.com/helios"><em>Helios</em></a>, by  Wright and Granger, at Ventnor Exchange, in Spring 2024. When we picked the theme of “Elemental Tales” for our <em>‘Tis Tales</em> show at Ventnor Fringe, 2024, it seemed like a good tale to tell in that context.</p>
<p>A version of the tale appears in narrative form in Bulfinch’s <em>“Age of Fable, or, Stories of gods and heroes”</em> of 1855.</p>
<div class="warning admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Pronunciation note</p>
<p>There are various spellings and accentuations of our lead character’s name (Phaethon, Phaëthon, Phaeton, etc.) and examples of different forms of pronunciation of it. After chatting to several people (Elton Barker, Paul Cowdell) I think I have settled on Phi-(uh)-thon.</p>

<p>PHAËTON.</p>
<p>Phaëton was the son of Apollo and the nymph Clymene. One day a schoolfellow laughed at the idea of his being the son of the god, and Phaeton went in rage and shame and reported it to his mother. “If,” said he, “I am indeed of heavenly birth, give me, mother, some proof of it, and establish my claim to the honor.” Clymene strtetched forth her hands towards the skies, and said, “I call to witness the Sun which looks down upon us, that I have told you the truth. If I speak falsely, let this be the last time I behold his light. But it needs not much labor to go and inquire for yourself; the land whence the Sun rises lies next to ours. Go and demand of him whether he will own you as a son.” Phaeton heard with delight. He travelled to India, which lies directly in the regions of sunrise; and, full of hope and pride, approached the goal whence his parent begins his course.</p>
<p>The palace of the Sun stood reared aloft on columns, glittering with gold and precious stones, while polished ivory formed the ceilings, and silver the doors. The workmanship surpassed the material <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Materiem</span> <span class="pre">superabat</span> <span class="pre">opus.</span> <span class="pre">—</span> <span class="pre">Ovid.]</span></code>; for upon the walls Vulcan had represented earth, sea and skies, with their inhabitants. In the sea were the nymphs, some sporting in the waves, some riding on the backs of fishes, while others sat upon the rocks and dried their sea-green hair. Their faces were not all alike, nor yet unlike, — but such as sisters’ ought to be. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Facies</span> <span class="pre">non</span> <span class="pre">omnibus</span> <span class="pre">una,</span> <span class="pre">Nec</span> <span class="pre">diversa</span> <span class="pre">tamen,</span> <span class="pre">qualem</span> <span class="pre">decet</span> <span class="pre">esse</span> <span class="pre">sororum.</span> <span class="pre">—</span> <span class="pre">Ovid.]</span></code> The earth had its towns and forests and rivers and rustic divinities. Over all was carved the likeness of the glorious heaven; and on the silver doors the twelve signs of the zodiac, six on each side.</p>
<p>Clymene’s son advanced up the steep ascent, and entered the halls of his disputed father. He approached the paternal presence, but stopped at a distance, for the light was more than he could bear. Phoebus, arrayed in a purple vesture, sat on a throne which glittered as with diamonds. On his right hand and his left stood the Day, the Month, and the Year, and, at regular intervals, the Hours. Spring stood with her head crowned with flowers, and Summer, with garment cast aside, and a garland formed of spears of ripened grain, and Autumn, with his feet stained with grape-juice, and icy Winter, with his hair stiffened with hoar frost. Surrounded by these attendants, the Sun, with the eye that sees every thing, beheld the youth dazzled with the novelty and splendor of the scene, and inquired the purpose of his errand. The youth replied, “O, light of the boundless world, Phoebus, my father, — if you permit me to use that name, — give me some proof, I beseech you, by which I may be known as yours.” He ceased; and his father, laying aside the beams that shone all around his head, bade him approach, and embracing him, said, “My son, you deserve not to be disowned, and I confirm what your mother has told you. To put an end to your doubts, ask what you will, the gift shall be yours. I call to witness that dreadful lake, which I never saw, but which we gods swear by in our most solemn engagements.” Phaëton immediately asked to be permitted for one day to drive the chariot of the sun. The father repented of his promise; thrice and four times he shook his radiant head in warning. “I have spoken rashly,” said he; “this only request I would fain deny. I beg you to withdraw it. It is not a safe boon, nor one, my Phaëton, suited to your youth and strength. Your lot is mortal, and you ask what is beyond a mortal’s power. In your ignorance you aspire to do that which not even the gods themselves may do. None but myself may drive the flaming car of day. Not even Jupiter, whose terrible right arm hurls the thunderbolts. The first part of the way is steep, and such as the horses when fresh in the morning can hardly climb; the middle is high up in the heavens, whence I myself can scarcely, without alarm, look down and behold the earth and sea stretched beneath me. The last part of the road descends rapidly, and requires most careful driving. Tethys, who is waiting to receive me, often trembles for me lest I should fall headlong. Add to all this, the heaven is all the time turning round and carrying the stars with it. I have to be perpetually on my guard lest that movement, which sweeps every thing else along, should hurry me also away. Suppose I should lend you the chariot, what would you do? Could you keep your course while the sphere was revolving under you? Perhaps you think that there are forests and cities, the abodes of gods, and palaces and temples on the way. On the contrary, the road is through the midst of frightful monsters. You pass by the horns of the Bull, in front of the Archer, and near the Lion’s jaws, and where the Scorpion stretches its arms in one direction and the Crab in another. Nor will you find it easy to guide those horses, with their breasts full of fire that they breathe forth from their mouths and nostrils. I can scarcely govern them myself, when they are unruly and resist the reins. Beware, my son, lest I be the donor of a fatal gift; recall your request while yet you may. Do you ask me for a proof that you are sprung from my blood? I give you a proof in my fears for you. Look at my face, — I would that you could look into my breast, you would there see all a father’s anxiety. Finally,” he continued, “look round the world and choose whatever you will of what earth or sea contains most precious, — ask it and fear no refusal. This only I pray you not to urge. It is not honor, but destruction you seek. Why do you hang round my neck and still entreat me? You shall have it if you persist, — the oath is sworn and must be kept, — but I beg you to choose more wisely.”</p>
<p>He ended; but the youth rejected all admonition, and held to his demand. So, having resisted as long as he could, Phoebus at last led the way to where stood the lofty chariot.</p>
<p>It was of gold, the gift of Vulcan; the axle was of gold, the pole and wheels of gold, the spokes of silver. Along the seat were rows of chrysolites and diamonds, which reflected all around the brightness of the sun. While the daring youth gazed in admiration, the early Dawn threw open the purple doors of the east, and showed the pathway strewn with roses. The stars withdrew, marshalled by the Daystar, which last of all retired also. The father, when he saw the earth beginning to glow, and the Moon preparing to retire, ordered the Hours to harness up the horses. They obeyed, and led forth from the lofty stalls the steeds full fed with ambrosia, and attached the reins. Then the father bathed the face of his son with a powerful unguent, and made him capable of enduring the brightness of the flame. He set the rays on his head, and, with a foreboding sigh, said, “If, my son, you will in this at least heed my advice, spare the whip and hold tight the reins. They go fast enough of their own accord; the labor is to hold them in. You are not to take the straight road directly between the five circles, but turn off to the left. Keep within the limit of the middle zone, and avoid the northern and the southern alike. You will see the marks of the wheels, and they will serve to guide you. And, that the skies and the earth may each receive their due share of heat, go not too high, or you will burn the heavenly dwellings, nor too low, or you will set the earth on fire; the middle course is safest and best <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Medio</span> <span class="pre">tutissimus</span> <span class="pre">ibis.</span> <span class="pre">—</span> <span class="pre">Ovid.</span> <span class="pre">&quot;You</span> <span class="pre">will</span> <span class="pre">go</span> <span class="pre">most</span> <span class="pre">safely</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">middle.&quot;]</span></code>. And now I leave you to your chance, which I hope will plan better for you than you have done for yourself. Night is passing out of the western gates and we can delay no longer. Take the reins; but if at last your heart fails you, and you will benefit by my advice, stay where you are in safety, and suffer me to light and warm the earth.” The agile youth sprang into the chariot, stood erect and grasped the reins with delight, pouring out thanks to his reluctant parent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the horses fill the air with their snortings and fiery breath, and stamp the ground impatient. Now the bars are let down, and the boundless plain of the universe lies open before them. They dart forward and cleave the opposing clouds, and outrun the morning breezes which started from the same eastern goal. The steeds soon perceived that the load they drew was lighter than usual; and as a ship without ballast is tossed hither and thither on the sea, so the chariot, without its accustomed weight, was dashed about as if empty. They rush headlong and leave the travelled road. He is alarmed, and knows not how to guide them; nor, if he knew, has he the power. Then, for the first time, the Great and Little Bear were scorched with heat, and would fain, if it were possible, have plunged into the water; and the Serpent which lies coiled up round the north pole, torpid and harmless, grew warm, and with warmth felt its rage revive. Bootes, they say, fled away, though encumbered with his plough, and all unused to rapid motion.</p>
<p>When hapless Phaeton looked down upon the earth, now spreading in vast extent beneath him, he grew pale and his knees shook with terror. In spite of the glare all around him, the sight of his eyes grew dim. He wished he had never touched his father’s horses, never learned his parentage, never prevailed in his request. He is borne along like a vessel that flies before a tempest, when the pilot can do no more and betakes himself to his prayers. What shall he do? Much of the heavenly road is left behind, but more remains before. He turns his eyes from one direction to the other; now to the goal whence he began his course, now to the realms of sunset which he is not destined to reach. He loses his selfcommand, and knows not what to do, — whether to draw tight the reins or throw them loose; he forgets the names of the horses. He sees with terror the monstrous forms scattered over the surface of heaven. Here the Scorpion extended his two great arms, with his tail and crooked claws stretching over two signs of the zodiac. When the boy beheld him, reeking with poison and menacing with his fangs, his courage failed, and the reins fell from his hands. The horses, when they felt them loose on their backs, dashed headlong, and unrestrained went off into unknown regions of the sky, in among the stars, hurling the chariot over pathless places, now up in high heaven, now down almost to the earth. The moon saw with astonishment her brother’s chariot running beneath her own. The clouds begin to smoke, and the mountain tops take fire; the fields are parched with heat, the plants wither, the trees with their leafy branches burn, the harvest is ablaze! But these are small things. Great cities perished, with their walls and towers; whole nations with their people were consumed to ashes! The forest-clad mountains burned, Athos and Taurus and Tmolus and CEte; Ida, once celebrated for fountains, but now all dry; the Muses’ mountain Helicon, and Hremus; AEtna, with fires within and without, and Parnassus, with his two peaks, and Rhodope, forced at last to part with his snowy crown. Her cold climate was no protection to Scythia, Caucasus burned, and Ossa and Pindus, and, greater than both, Olympus; the Alps high in air, and the Apennines crowned with clouds.</p>
<p>Then Phaeton beheld the world on fire, and felt the heat intolerable. The air he breathed was like the air of a furnace and full of burning ashes, and the smoke was of a pitchy darkness. He dashed forward he knew not whither. Then, it is believed, the people of AEthiopia became black by the blood being forced so suddenly to the surface, and the Libyan desert was dried up to the condition in which it remains to this day. The Nymphs of the fountains, with dishevelled hair, mourned their waters, nor were the rivers safe beneath their banks; Tanais smoked, and Caicus, Xanthus and Meander. Babylonian Euphrates and Ganges, Tagus with golden sands, and Cayster where the swans resort. Nile fled away and hid his head in the desert, and there it still remains concealed. Where he used to discharge his waters through seven mouths into the sea, there seven dry channels alone remained. The earth cracked open, and through the chinks light broke into Tartarus, and frightened the king of shadows and his queen. The sea shrank up. Where before was water, it became a dry plain; and the mountains that lie beneath the waves lifted up their heads and became islands. The fishes sought the lowest depths, and the dolphins no longer ventured as usual to sport on the surface. Even Nereus, and his wife Doris, with the Nereids, their daughters, sought the deepest caves for refuge. Thrice Neptune essayed to raise his head above the surface, and thrice was driven back by the heat. Earth, surrounded as she was by waters, yet with head and shoulders bare, screening her face with her hand, looked up to heaven, and with a husky voice called on Jupiter.</p>
<p>“O, ruler of the gods, if I have deserved this treatment, and it is your will that I perish with fire, why withhold your thunderbolts? Let me at least fall by your hand. Is this the reward of my fertility, of my obedient service? Is it for this that I have supplied herbage for cattle, and fruits for men, and frankincense for your altars? But if I am unworthy of regard, what has my brother Ocean done to deserve such a fate? If neither of us can excite your pity, think, I pray you, of your own heaven, and behold how both the poles are smoking which sustain your palace, which must fall if they be destroyed. Atlas faints, and scarce holds up his burden. If sea, earth, and heaven perish, we fall into ancient Chaos. Save what yet remains to us from the devouring flame. O, take thought for our deliverance in this awful moment!”</p>
<p>Thus spoke Earth, and overcome with heat and thirst, could say no more. Then Jupiter omnipotent, calling to witness all the gods, including him who had lent the chariot, and showing them that all was lost unless some speedy remedy were applied, mounted the lofty tower from whence he diffuses clouds over the earth, and hurls the forked lightnings. But at that time not a cloud was to be found to interpose for a screen to earth, nor was a shower remaining unexhausted. He thundered, and brandishing a lightning bolt in his right hand launched it against the charioteer, and struck him at the same moment from his seat and from existence! Phaëton, with his hair on fire, fell headlong, like a shooting star which marks the heavens with its brightness as it falls, and Eridanus, the great river, received him and cooled his burning frame. The Italian Naiads reared a tomb for him, and inscribed these words upon the stone:—</p>
<p>“Driver of Phoebus’ chariot, Phaëton,<br />
Struck by Jove’s thunder, rests beneath this stone.<br />
He could not rule his father’s car of fire,<br />
Yet was it much so nobly to aspire.”</p>

<p>His sisters, the Heliades, as they lamented his fate, were turned into poplar trees, on the banks of the river, and their tears, which continued to flow, became amber as they dropped into the stream.</p>
<p>Milman, in his poem of Samor, makes the following allusion to Phaëton’s story:—</p>
<p>“As when the palsied universe aghast<br />
Lay * * * * mute and still,<br />
When drove, so poets sing, the Sun-born youth<br />
Devious through Heaven’s affrighted signs his sire’s<br />
Ill-granted chariot. Him the Thunderer hurled<br />
From th’ empyrean headlong to the gulf<br />
Of the half-parched Eridanus, where weep<br />
Even now the sister trees their amber tears<br />
O’er Phaëton untimely dead.”</p>
<p>In the beautiful lines of Walter Savage Landor, descriptive of the Sea-shell, there is an allusion to the Sun’s palace and chariot. The water-nymph says,—</p>
<p>“I have sinuous shells of pearly hue<br />
Within, and things that lustre have imbibed<br />
In the sun’s palace porch, where when unyoked<br />
His chariot wheel stands midway in the wave.<br />
Shake one and it awakens; then apply<br />
Its polished lip to your attentive ear,<br />
And it remembers its august abodes,<br />
And murmurs as the ocean murmurs there.”</p>

<p>Bulfinch’s version is a reasonably close retelling of Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em>, introduced at the end of Book 1 and then continuing at the start of Book II.</p>
<p>The set-up derives from Phaeton boasting of his immortal parentage to Epaphus, in a tale that also tells of Epaphus’ mother, Io’s, encounter with his immortal father, Zeus (Jupiter).</p>

<p>[96] At these words, Dionysos rejoiced in hope of victory; then he questioned Hermes and wished to hear more of the Olympian tale which the Celts of the west know well: how Phaethon tumbled over and over through the air, and why even the daughters of Helios were changed into trees beside the moaning Eridanos, and from their leafy trees drop sparkling tears into the stream.</p>
<p>[103] In answer, friendly Hermes opened his mouth and noised out his inspired tale to Bacchos eagerly listening:</p>
<p>[105] “Dionysos, joy of mankind, shepherd of human life! If sweet desire constrains you to hear these ancient stories, I will tell you the whole tale of Phaethon from beginning to end. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[For</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">literary</span> <span class="pre">history</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">Phaethon</span> <span class="pre">from</span> <span class="pre">Alexandrian</span> <span class="pre">times</span> <span class="pre">on,</span> <span class="pre">see</span> <span class="pre">G.</span> <span class="pre">Knaack,</span> <span class="pre">[Quaestions</span> <span class="pre">Phaëthonteae,</span> <span class="pre">Berlin</span> <span class="pre">1886.]</span></code></p>
<p>[108] “Loudbooming Oceanos, girdled with the circle of the sky, who leads his water earth-encompassing round the turning point which he bathes, was joined in primeval wedlock with Tethys. The watery bridegroom begat Clymene, fairest of the Naiads, whom Tethys nursed on her wet breast, her youngest, a maiden with lovely arms. For her beauty Helios pined, Helios who spins round the twelvemonth lichtgang <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[TH:</span> <span class="pre">German,</span> <span class="pre">light</span> <span class="pre">corridor]</span></code>, and travels the sevenzone circuit <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[The</span> <span class="pre">Zodiac</span> <span class="pre">(because</span> <span class="pre">all</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">planets</span> <span class="pre">move</span> <span class="pre">within</span> <span class="pre">it).</span> <span class="pre">The</span> <span class="pre">Greeks</span> <span class="pre">called</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">seven</span> <span class="pre">heavenly</span> <span class="pre">bodies</span> <span class="pre">planets;</span> <span class="pre">these</span> <span class="pre">were</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">real</span> <span class="pre">planets,</span> <span class="pre">Mercury,</span> <span class="pre">Venus,</span> <span class="pre">Mars,</span> <span class="pre">Jupiter,</span> <span class="pre">Saturn,</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">also</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">sun</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">moon.</span> <span class="pre">Thus</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Zodiac</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">called</span> <span class="pre">sevenzoned.</span> <span class="pre">Note</span> <span class="pre">that</span> <span class="pre">they</span> <span class="pre">did</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">regard</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Earth</span> <span class="pre">as</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">planet,</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">did</span> <span class="pre">not</span> <span class="pre">know</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">planets</span> <span class="pre">Uranus</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">Neptune</span> <span class="pre">(+</span> <span class="pre">Pluto)]</span></code> garland-wise — Helios dispenser of fire was afflicted with another fire! The torch of love was stronger than the blaze of his car and the shining of his rays, when over the bend of the reddened Ocean as he bathed his fiery form in the eastern waters, he beheld the maiden close by the way, while she swam naked and sported in her father’s waves. Her body gleamed in her bath, she was one like the full Moon reflected in the evening waters, when she has filled the compass of her twin horns with light. Half-seen, unshod, the girl stood in the waves shooting the rosy shafts from her cheeks at Helios; her shape was outlined in the waters, no stomacher hid her maiden bosom, but the glowing circle of her round silvery breasts illuminated the stream.</p>
<p>[130] “ Her father united the girl to the heavenly charioteer. The lightfoot Seasons acclaimed Clymene’s bridal with Helios Lightbringer, the Naiad Nymphs danced around; in a watery bridal-bower the fruitful maiden was wedded in a flaming union, and received the hot bridegroom into her cool arms. The light that shone on that bridal bed came from the starry train; and the star of Cypris, Lucifer, herald of the union, wove a bridal song. Instead of the wedding torch, Selene sent her beams to attend the wedding. The Hesperides raised the joy-cry, and Oceanos beside his bride Tethys sounded his song with all the fountains of his throat.</p>
<p>[142] “Then Clymene’s womb swelled in that fruitful union, and when the birth ripened she brought forth a baby son divine and brilhant with light. At the boy’s birth his father’s ether saluted him with song; as he sprang from the childbed, the daughters of Oceanos cleansed him, Clymene’s son, in his grandsire’s waters, and wrapt him in swaddlings. The stars in shining movement leapt into the stream of Oceanos which they knew so well, and surrounded the boy, with Selene our Lady of Labour, sending forth her sparkling gleams. Helios gave his son his own name, as well suited the testimony of his form; for upon the boy’s shining face was visible the father’s inborn radiance.</p>
<p>[155] “Often in the course of the boy’s training Oceanos would have a pretty game, lifting Phaethon on his midbelly and letting him drop down; he would throw the boy high in the air, rolling over and over moving in a high path as quick as the wandering wind, and catch him again on his arm; then he would shoot him up again, and the boy would avoid the ready hand of Oceanos, and turn a somersault round and round till he splashed into the dark waters, prophet of his own death. The old man groaned when he saw it, recognizing the divine oracle, and hid all in prudent silence, that he might not tear the happy heart of Clymene the loving mother by foretelling the cruel threads of Phaethon’s Fate.</p>
<p>[167] “So the boy, hardly grown up, and still with no down on his lip, sometimes frequented his mother Clymene’s house, sometimes travelled even to the meadows of Thrinacia, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[The</span> <span class="pre">island</span> <span class="pre">(later</span> <span class="pre">identified</span> <span class="pre">with</span> <span class="pre">Sidly)</span> <span class="pre">where</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">cattle</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Sun</span> <span class="pre">were,</span> <span class="pre">see</span> <span class="pre">Od,</span> <span class="pre">xii.</span> <span class="pre">127;</span> <span class="pre">Lampetië</span> <span class="pre">was</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">charge</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">them.]</span></code> where he would often visit and stay with Lampetië, tending cattle and sheep … There he would long for his father the charioteer divine; made a wooden axle with skilful joinery, fitted on a sort of round wheel for his imitation car, fashioned yoke-straps, took three light withies from the flowering garden and plaited them into a lash, put unheard-of bridles on four young rams. Then he made a clever imitation of the morning star round like a wheel, out of a bunch of white flowers, and fixed it in front of his spokewheeled waggon to show the shape of the star Lucifer. He set burning torches standing about his hair on every side, and mimicked his father with fictitious rays as he drove round and round the coast of the seagirt isle.</p>
<p>[184] “But when he grew up into the fair bloom of youth, he often touched his father’s fire, lifted with his little hand the hot yokestraps and the starry whip, busied himself with the wheel, stroked the horses’ coats with snow-white hands — and so the playful boy enjoyed himself. With his right hand he touched the fireshotten bridle, mad with longing to manage the horses. Seated on his father’s knees, he shed imploring tears, and begged for a run with the fiery chariot and heavenly horses. His father said no, but he only begged and prayed all the more with gracious pleading. Then the father said in affectionate words to his young son in the highfaring car:</p>
<p>[196] “‘Dear son of Helios, dear grandson of Oceanos, ask me another boon; what have you to do with the chariot of the sky? Let alone the course of horsemanship. You cannot attain it, for you cannot guide my car — I can hardly drive it myself! Furious Ares never armed him with flaming thunderbolt, but he blares his tune with a trumpet, not with thunder. Hephaistos never collects his father’s clouds; he is not called Cloudgatherer like Cronion, but hammers his iron anvil in the forge, and pours artificial blasts of artificial wind. Apollo has a winged swan, not a running horse. Hermes keeps his rod and wears not his father’s aegis, lifts not his father’s fiery lightning. But you will say — “He gave Zagreus the flash of the thunderbolt.” Yes, Zagreus held the thunderbolt, and came to his death! Take good care, my child, that you too suffer not woes like his.’</p>
<p>[212] “‘So he spoke, but the boy would not listen; he prodded his father and wetted his tunic with hotter tears. He put out his hands and touched his father’s fiery beard; kneeling on the ground he bent his arched neck, pleading, and when the father saw, he pitied the boy. Clymene cried and begged too. Then although he knew in his heart the immovable inflexible spinnings of Fate, he consented regretful, and wiped with his tunic the rain of tears from the unsmiling face of sad Phaethon, and kissed the boy’s lips while he said:</p>
<p>[222] “‘There are twelve houses in all the fiery ether, set in the circle of the rounded Zodiac, one close after another in a row, each separate; through these alone is the inclined winding path of the restless planets rolling in their courses.

Passing into the lower house, opposite the Ram, I cast the light of equal day on the two hooves; and again I make day balanced equally with dark on my homeward course when I bring in the leafshaking course of the autumn Season, and drive with lesser light to the lower turningpoint in the leafshedding month. Then I bring winter for mankind with its rains, over the back of fishtailed Capricorn, that earth may bring forth her gifts full of life for the farmers, when she receives the bridal showers and the creative dew. I deck out also corntending summer the messenger of harvest, flogging the wheatbearing earth with hotter beams, while I drive at the highest point of my course <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[The</span> <span class="pre">summer</span> <span class="pre">solstice.]</span></code> in the Crab, who is right opposite to the cold Capricorn: both Nile and grapes together I make to grow.</p>
<p>[287] “‘When you begin your course, pass close by the side of Cerne, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Cf.</span> <span class="pre">xvi.</span> <span class="pre">45.]</span></code> and take Lucifer as guide to lead the way for your car, and you will not go astray; twelve circhng Hours <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[The</span> <span class="pre">Sun</span> <span class="pre">has</span> <span class="pre">twelve</span> <span class="pre">minor</span> <span class="pre">hours</span> <span class="pre">attendant</span> <span class="pre">upon</span> <span class="pre">him,</span> <span class="pre">which</span> <span class="pre">are</span> <span class="pre">elsewhere</span> <span class="pre">assigned</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">months,</span> <span class="pre">here</span> <span class="pre">clearly</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">hours</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">day.]</span></code> in turn will direct your way.’</p>
<p>[291] After this speech, he placed the golden helmet on Phaethon’s head and crowned him with his own fire, winding the seven rays like strings upon his hair, and put the white kilt girdlewise round him over his loins; he clothed him in his own fiery robe and laced his foot into the purple boot, and gave his chariot to his son. The Seasons brought the fiery horses of Helios from their eastern manger; Lucifer came boldly to the yoke, and fastened the horses’ necks in the bright yokestraps for their service.</p>
<p>[301] “Then Phaëthon mounted, Helios his father gave him the reins to manage, shining reins and gleaming whip: he shook in trembhng silence, for he understood that his son had not long to live. Clymene his mother could be half seen near the shore, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[i.e.</span> <span class="pre">she</span> <span class="pre">was</span> <span class="pre">up</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">her</span> <span class="pre">waist</span> <span class="pre">in</span> <span class="pre">water.]</span></code> as she watched her dear son mounting the flaming car, and shook with joy.</p>
<p>[307] “Already Lucifer was sparkling, that dewy star, and Phaethon rose traversing the eastern ambit, after his bath in the waters of Oceanos his grandsire. The bold driver of brilliant horses, running on high, scanned the heavens dotted with the company of the stars, girdled about by the seven Zones; he beheld the planets moving opposite, he saw the earth fixed in the middle like a centre, uplifted on tall cliffs and fortified on all sides by the winds in her caverns, he scanned the rivers, and the brows of Oceanos, driving back his own water into his own stream.</p>
<p>[318] “While he directed his eye to the upper air and the flood of stars, the diverse races of earth and the restless back of the sea, gazing round and round on the foundations of the infinite universe, the shining horses rolled along under the yoke over their usual course through the zodiac. Now inexperienced Phaëthon with his fiery whip could be seen flogging the horses’ necks; they went wild shrinking under the goad of their merciless charioteer, and all unwilling they ran away over the limit of their ancient road beyond the mark of the zodiac, expecting a different call from their familiar driver. Then there was tumult along the bounds of the South and the back of the North Wind; the quickfoot Seasons at the celestial gate wondered at the strange and unreal day, Dawn trembled, and star Lucifer cried out.</p>
<p>[333] “‘Where are you hurrying, dear boy? Why have you gone mad with reins in your hand? Spare your headstrong lash! Beware of these two companies— both planets and company of fixed stars, lest bold Orion kill you with his knife, lest ancient Boötes hit you with fiery cudgel. Spare this wild driving, and let not the Olympian Whale entomb you in his belly in high heaven; let not the Lion tear you to pieces, or the Olympian Bull arch his neck and strike you with fiery horn! Respect the Archer, or he may kill you with a firebarbed arrow from his drawn bowstring. Let there not be a second chaos, and the stars of heaven appear at the rising day, or erratic Dawn meet Selene at noonday in her car!’</p>
<p>[347] “As he spoke, Phaethon drove harder still, drawing his car aside to South, to North, close to the West, near to the East. There was tumult in the sky shaking the joints of the immovable universe: the very axle bent which runs through the middle of the revolving heavens. Libyan Atlas could hardly support the selfrolling firmament of stars, as he rested on his knees with bowed back under this greater burden. Now the Serpent scraped with his writhing belly the equator far away from the Bear, and hissed as he met with the starry Bull; the Lion roared out of his throat against the scorching Dog, heating the air with ravening fire, and stood boldly to attack the eight claws of the Crab with his shaggy hair bristling, while the heavenly Lion’s thirsty tail flogged the Virgin hard by his hind leg, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Leo</span> <span class="pre">lashed</span> <span class="pre">his</span> <span class="pre">tail</span> <span class="pre">so</span> <span class="pre">hard</span> <span class="pre">that</span> <span class="pre">it</span> <span class="pre">hit</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">next</span> <span class="pre">constellation,</span> <span class="pre">Virgo!]</span></code> and the winged Maiden darting past the Waggoner came near the pole and met the Wain. The Morning Star sent forth his straying light in the setting region of the West and pushed away the Evening Star who met him there. Dawn wandered about; blazing Sirius grabbed the thirsty Bear <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[&quot;Thirsty,&quot;</span> <span class="pre">because</span> <span class="pre">it</span> <span class="pre">nerer</span> <span class="pre">sets</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">ao</span> <span class="pre">water.]</span></code> instead of his usual Hare. The two starry Fishes left one the South and one the North, and leapt in Olympos near Aquarius; the Dolphin danced in a ring and tumbled about with Capricorn. Scorpios also had wandered around from the southern path until he came near to Orion and touched his sword — Orion trembled even among the stars, lest he might creep up slowly and pierce his feet once again with a sharp sting. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[When</span> <span class="pre">he</span> <span class="pre">was</span> <span class="pre">on</span> <span class="pre">earth,</span> <span class="pre">Orion</span> <span class="pre">was</span> <span class="pre">killed</span> <span class="pre">by</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">sting</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">huge</span> <span class="pre">scorpion,</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">two</span> <span class="pre">constellations</span> <span class="pre">commemorate</span> <span class="pre">this.]</span></code> The Moon leapt up at midday, spitting off the half-completed light from her face and growing black on the surface, for she could no longer steal the counterfeit light from the male torch of Phaëthon opposite and milk out his inborn flame. The sevenstar voices of the Pleiades rang circling round the sevenzone sky with echoing sound; the planets from as many <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Presumably</span> <span class="pre">six;</span> <span class="pre">one</span> <span class="pre">planet,</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">Sun,</span> <span class="pre">was</span> <span class="pre">otherwise</span> <span class="pre">engaged.</span> <span class="pre">There</span> <span class="pre">are</span> <span class="pre">six</span> <span class="pre">Pleiades,</span> <span class="pre">omitting</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">one</span> <span class="pre">(Electra)</span> <span class="pre">which</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">too</span> <span class="pre">dim</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">see</span> <span class="pre">clearly.]</span></code> throats raised an outcry and rushed wildly against them. Cypris pushed Zeus, Ares Cronos <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Venus,</span> <span class="pre">Jupiter,</span> <span class="pre">Mars,</span> <span class="pre">Saturn.]</span></code>; my own wandering star <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[The</span> <span class="pre">planet</span> <span class="pre">Mercury.]</span></code> approached the Pleiad of Spring, and mingling a kindred light with the seven stars he rose halfseen beside my mother Maia — he turned away from the heavenly chariot, beside which he always runs or before it in the morning, and in the evening when Helios sets he sends his following light, and because he keeps equal course with him and travels with equal portion, astronomers have named him the Sun’s Heart. Europa’s bridegroom the Olympian Bull bellowed, stretching his neck drenched with damp snowflakes; he raised a foot curved for a run, and inclining his head sideways with its sharp horn against Phaëthon, stamped on the heavenly vault with fiery hooves. Bold Orion drew sword from sheath hanging by his glowing thigh; Boötes shook his cudgel; Pegasos neighed rearing and shaking the knees of his starry legs — halfseen <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[The</span> <span class="pre">figure</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">constellation</span> <span class="pre">shows</span> <span class="pre">only</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">front</span> <span class="pre">half</span> <span class="pre">of</span> <span class="pre">the</span> <span class="pre">heavenly</span> <span class="pre">horse,</span> <span class="pre">here</span> <span class="pre">called</span> <span class="pre">Pegasos.]</span></code> the Libyan courser trod the firmament with his foot and galloped towards the Swan his neighbour, angrily flapping his wings, that again he might send another rider hurtling down from the sky as he had once thrown Bellerophontes himself out of the heavenly vault. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[When</span> <span class="pre">he</span> <span class="pre">tried</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">ride</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">heaven</span> <span class="pre">on</span> <span class="pre">Pegasos's</span> <span class="pre">back.]</span></code> No longer the circling Bears danced back to back beside the northern turningpost on high; but they passed to the south, and bathed their unwashen feet in the unfamiliar Ocean beside the western main.</p>
<p>[410] “Then Father Zeus struck down Phaëthon with a thunderbolt, and sent him rolling helplessly from on high into the stream of Eridanos. He fixed again the joints which held all together with their primeval union, gave back the horses to Helios, brought the heavenly chariot to the place of rising; and the agile Hours that attended upon Phaëthon followed their ancient course. All the earth laughed again. Rain from lifebreeding Zeus cleared all the fields, and with moist showers quenched the wandering fires, all that the glowing horses had spat whinnying from their flaming throats out of the sky over all the earth. Helios rose driving his car on his road again; the crops grew, the orchards laughed again, receiving as of yore the life-giving warmth from the sky.</p>
<p>[424] “But Father Zeus fixed Phaëthon in Olympos, like a Charioteer, and bearing that name. As he holds in the radiant Chariot of the heavens with shining arm, he has the shape of a Charioteer starting upon his course, as if even among the stars he longed again for his father’s car. The fire-scorched river also came up to the vault of the stars with consent of Zeus, and in the starry circle rolls the meandering stream of burning Eridanos <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[The</span> <span class="pre">Milky</span> <span class="pre">Way.]</span></code>.</p>
<p>[432] “But the sisters of the charioteer fallen to his early death changed their shape into trees, and from the weeping trees they distil precious dew <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[Amber.]</span></code> out of their leaves.”</p>
